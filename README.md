# Prometheus Neural Network

The Prometheus Project is a long term project with the aim of developing a swarm of drones that can navigate new environments, for purposes such as search and rescue. 

This repository is for the AI division of the project, specifically the Neural Network sub-division. The purpose of this project is to develop a neural network that takes sensor data from a drone as input and navigates it in such a way to avoid collisions. A 2D grid environment is utilized for now with the drone seeing a certain portion of the grid spaces in front of it.


## Usage

If you would like to run a quick demo or test, you can simply run DroneMain.java 

If you would like to set your own parameters for the training of the drone, and the design of the world/grid it's set in, a more in-depth breakdown of instructions can be found in Christopher O'Connor's Project Report.
